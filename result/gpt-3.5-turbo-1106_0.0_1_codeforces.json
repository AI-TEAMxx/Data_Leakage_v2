A \n\n**set**\n\n ends \n\n**exactly**\n\n when one of the players reaches $X$ wins in the \n\n**plays**\n\n of that \n\n**set**\n\n. This player is declared the winner of the \n\n**set**\n\n. The players play \n\n**sets**\n\n until one of them reaches $Y$ wins in the \n\n**sets**\n\n. After that, the game ends, and this player is declared the winner of the entire game.\n\nYou have just watched a game but didn't notice who was declared the winner. You remember that during the game, $n$ \n\n**plays**\n\n were played, and you know which player won each \n\n**play**\n\n. However, you \n\n**do not know**\n\n the values of $X$ and $Y$. Based on the available information, determine who won the entire game — A or B. If there is not enough information to determine the winner, you should also report it.Input:Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $t$ $(1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4)$ - the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer $n$ $(1 \\leq n \\leq 20)$ - the number of \n\n**plays**\n\n played during the game.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains a string $s$ of length $n$, consisting of characters $\\texttt{A}$ and $\\texttt{B}$. If $s_i = \\texttt{A}$, it means that player A won the $i$-th \n\n**play**\n\n.
