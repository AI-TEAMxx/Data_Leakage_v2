{"task_id": 60, "prompt": "'''One day, Vlad became curious about who he can have a conversation with on the escalator in the subway. There are a total of $n$ passengers. The escalator has a total of $m$ steps, all steps indexed from $1$ to $m$ and $i$-th step has height $i \\cdot k$.\n\nVlad's height is $H$ centimeters. Two people with heights $a$ and $b$ can have a conversation on the escalator if they are standing on \n\n**different**\n\n steps and the height difference between them is equal to the height difference between the steps.\n\nFor example, if two people have heights $170$ and $180$ centimeters, and $m = 10, k = 5$, then they can stand on steps numbered $7$ and $5$, where the height difference between the steps is equal to the height difference between the two people: $k \\cdot 2 = 5 \\cdot 2 = 10 = 180 - 170$. There are other possible ways.\n\nGiven an array $h$ of size $n$, where $h_i$ represents the height of the $i$-th person. Vlad is interested in how many people he can have a conversation with on the escalator \n\n**individually**\n\n.\n\nFor example, if $n = 5, m = 3, k = 3, H = 11$, and $h = [5, 4, 14, 18, 2]$, Vlad can have a conversation with the person with height $5$ (Vlad will stand on step $1$, and the other person will stand on step $3$) and with the person with height $14$ (for example, Vlad can stand on step $3$, and the other person will stand on step $2$). Vlad cannot have a conversation with the person with height $2$ because even if they stand on the extreme steps of the escalator, the height difference between them will be $6$, while their height difference is $9$. Vlad cannot have a conversation with the rest of the people on the escalator, so the answer for this example is $2$.Input:The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 1000$) — the number of test cases.\n\nThen the descriptions of the test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains integers: $n, m, k, H$ ($1 \\le n,m \\le 50$, $1 \\le k,H \\le 10^6$).
